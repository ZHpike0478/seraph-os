/**
 * What a program's halves have said, kept.
 *
 * A program says something and it is kept. Server pipes arrive as raw
 * stdout and stderr; a client endpoint mirrors the console through its
 * private boundary. Neither is a request: recording is best-effort and
 * can never delay or disturb the program that produced it.
 *
 * Which is also why reading opens its own connection **read-only**. Not
 * a rule that a query must begin with `select`, which would mean parsing
 * SQL and being right about it forever — a property of the handle, which
 * the database enforces whatever arrives.
 *
 * It lives at `storage/logs.sqlite`, beside the `store.sqlite` this
 * copies: a thing the system manages, that the program has no word for,
 * that survives an update because everything under `storage` does, and
 * that goes with `uninstall({ purge: true })`. Nothing new had to be said anywhere
 * for any of that.
 *
 * **The system is the only writer.** Every process of every program
 * writes through the core, so nothing here contends and a line's rowid
 * is the order the system drained it — which is the only order it can
 * honestly claim, two pipes having no order between them.
